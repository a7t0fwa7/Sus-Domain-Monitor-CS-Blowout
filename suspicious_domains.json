    "Spencer H., CHCIO, FACHE July 19, 2024 \n\nI am a Certified Healthcare CIO, so I have years of background working in this field. There is a lot of friction between the \u201cnew\u201d generation of IT Leaders and my generation of IT leaders. My generation has always focused much effort on testing and regression testing of code and patches, the result being longer patch cycles. New DevOps teams want to patch more often with less testing. Both approaches have their pros and cons. This is an example of the \u201cold\u201d way of testing being more appropriate. In my world, if we had 10 variants of Windows Operating Systems (Windows 10, release xxxxxx, Windows 11, release xxxxxx), I would require 1000 tests to be run, 100 on each variant, before we released to PROD. In todays DevOps world, it is common to minimize testing, and just fix \u201cwhatever breaks\u201d on the backend, after-the-fact.  The reality is that we need to meet in the middle between these two processes and come up with something that prevents this from happening. \nThere is truly no excuse for this. IMO, the CIO, CTO, and the CEO needs to be held accountable for this, as this is one of the most basic process issues of any technology department, much less a technology company.\n\n\nReply \u2192",
